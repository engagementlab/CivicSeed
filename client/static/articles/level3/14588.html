			As a college student working in collaboration with community members, it is important to remember the concept of community partnership discussed  in Part 2.  An effective partnership is mutually beneficial. Keep this is mind as you move through your project. / You were told in Level 1 that in Level 3 you would “learn about combining the goals and outcomes you have set for yourself as a student with the goals and desired outcomes of the community organization. Personal goals benefit you; project goals benefit the community. When these two perspectives are both understood and combined, a foundation is set for a mutually beneficial partnership.
