      It is important for both you and your community partner to understand if your work has been effective. Were your goals met? Were the organization’s goals met? Did your work make a difference? Were there lessons learned that can be applied to future work? You, your community partner organization’s supervisor or contact person, and the individuals you worked with may all have different opinions and perspectives. Since you set out goals and objectives in Part 1 and Part 3 of this tool, you have something to measure. It would be most helpful to talk with those you are working with (at minimum) at the midpoint (to ensure you are progressing and moving in the right direction) and end of your project or program.
