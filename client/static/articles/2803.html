      Even though this game does not include Grafton, Grafton is home to the Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. Since it is approximately an hour from the Medford/Somerville and Boston campuses to Grafton, there is not much travel possible. Cummings students provide service to Grafton and its surrounding communities that include Worcester.
