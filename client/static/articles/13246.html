		<h2>Ways to build your leadership skills and knowledge</h2>
		 <ul>
		 	<li>
		 		Pay attention to the ways in which your community partners lead their organizations. You have an opportunity to work with people actually creating community change and to learn from them.
		 	</li>
		 	<li>
		 		Take risks: offer to assist with things outside your comfort zone (with support) that will build skills in new areas
		 	</li>
		 	<li>
		 		Step up to the plate: does your group need a committee chair or vice president and no one is volunteering? Why not you?
		 	</li>
		 	<li>
		 		Did you know that Tufts has a Leadership Studies Minor? This interdisciplinary minor provides you with opportunities to study leadership theories from multiple perspectives, increase your understanding of leadership in society, and apply your knowledge through a capstone project. For more information, <a href='http://ase.tufts.edu/leadershipstudies/' target="_blank">click here</a>
			</li>
		 	<li>
		 		Talk about your community work with your friends and classmates. The way you speak about your work in different contexts will increase your own learning while sharing your knowledge with others.
		 	</li>
		 	<li>
		 		Invite others to participate with you. Involve neighbors in your residence hall, teammates, other student groups- spread the involvement and inspire others!
