## Considering Sustainability

Even though we are discussing sustainability in the last level, it is actually helpful to consider it from the outset of your project. What do we mean by “sustainability?” A project is sustainable if it can continue after you leave, as long as the need still exists (some projects may be designed to address an immediate need and intentionally be of short-term duration). College students come and go. Your availability may change from semester to semester; your goals and interests may change from year to year. That does not mean that the issue you were addressing is necessarily resolved in your timeframe. As a responsible, ethical participant, you should be considering the sustainability of your work before you begin, and be working with the community to develop a plan for continuing the work in your absence. If it has no possibility of being sustained and might even create harm, the project was not well conceived. This would point to reconsidering implementing the project. __The greatest key to sustainability is engaging the community in the solution, working together, and having the community members take ownership of the project.__
